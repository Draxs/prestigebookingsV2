        <h3 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">Summer</h3>
        <p class="text-justify font-md">June through to September is summertime in Paphos; high temperatures are coupled with almost no rain. Temperatures peak in July and August when daytime temperatures in the mid-30s are not uncommon. The average high temperature is just below 30°C for the entire season. Fairly low humidity and sea breezes help to keep things more comfortable but it is always very hot and taking a siesta in the peak of the day is advisable. Those wanting an active holiday might find the summer heat restrictive. The sun stays out for 12 hours per day in June and July and is only slightly shier in the following months. From June till August it is very rare to experience a rainy day. The sea temperature peaks in August at 27°C.</p>
        <h3 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">Autumn</h3>
        <p class="text-justify font-md">From October till November the weather remains excellent and the crowds thin out. The temperature reduces to an average high of 26°C in October and 22°C in November and to average lows of 16°C and 12°C respectively. These temperatures are more comfortable than the inescapable summer heat; hot days followed by cool nights would seem to be preferable but summer remains the most popular season, which in turn makes autumn even more attractive. October sees a little rain and November heralds the start of the wet season – though you’ll still only get about 7 days per month of rainfall on average. Showers are usually short but heavy. Occasionally the area can get strong thunderstorms with heavy, localized rainfall. In October 2006 heavy storms brought unusually high rainfall and even hail to Paphos. Thunderstorms are at their most common in autumn and winter. Sunshine levels remain good and the sea stays more than warm enough for swimming.</p>
        <h3 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">Winter</h3>
        <p class="text-justify font-md">From December till February Paphos experiences an exceptionally mild winter. In fact, on many days one might sit comfortably in a t-shirt in the midday sun as temperatures can still reach upwards of 20ºC. The average high temperature decreases to 19°C in December and 17°C in January and February. The average low does fall below 10°C and on the very rare occasion can touch 0°C. The warm days are sometimes interrupted with cool, blustery weather and the nights are always chilly. This is the period where Paphos gets most of its yearly rain. January is the wettest month on average with a mean 9 days seeing rainfall. The yearly rainfall in Paphos is just above 400mm on average and much of this falls in the short, heavy winter downpours. The sun stays out for around five hours per day and the sea is debatably just warm enough for swimming. Those that brave swimming on British seaside holidays will find the 17°C water positively balmy. If you are in Paphos in winter and find yourself wanting some proper winter weather you can find it in the nearby Troodos Mountains. In fact, you’ll even find a ski resort. Generally, there is snow in the higher mountains (that reach up to 2000m) between January and March, so you can ski in the morning then sunbathe in the afternoon.</p>
        <h3 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">Spring</h3>
        <p class="text-justify font-md">The period between March and May beats an English summer hands down. It is sunnier, hotter and drier. It is also outside of the peak tourist season. The average high temperature rises to 18°C in March, 21°C in April and 24°C in May. The average low temperature stays chilly around 10°C in March and April but gets up to 14°C in April. From early April beach days resume, though the sea is still a bit nippy and cool winds can inspire the odd shiver. The clouds stampede away taking the rain with them and leaving instead longer and longer hours of sunshine. March sees seven hours of sun per day, April nine and May ten. May sees very little rainfall and it steadily decreases from the beginning of the season. From the end of April rain becomes a forgotten inconvenience with only the odd, gentle reminder.</p>

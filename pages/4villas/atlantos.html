                Off street and undercover parking is available on the villaâ€™s gated driveway.</p>
                <h3>Local Area</h3>
                <p>The Sea Caves area is situated in a peaceful location between the popular resort of Coral Bay and the tiny fishing hamlet of St Georges. The coastline in this area is full of natural rock caves making it ideal snorkelling territory, however if you prefer an organised beach then the family oriented resort of Coral Bay is less than 10 minutes drive away.<br>
                Coral Bay is the well known beach resort for the Paphos district and has become a lively resort with plenty to offer in terms of amenities and activities. The centre of the resort features a wide selection of restaurants offering both Cypriot and International Cuisines, cafes, bars, shops, a choice of supermarkets, several banks, a chemist and a laundry.</p>
                <p>The resort boasts two sandy beaches, the closest one to the villa being Corallia Bay, the quieter of the two. A little further along the coast is the, the popular and busy Coral Bay Beach, a sandy horseshoe shaped bay honoured with a Blue Flag of the European Union. Sunbeds and umbrellas are available for hire, watersports are on offer and there are two beach cafÃ©s providing refreshments.
                For a taste of the more traditional, the Church at St George overlooks the modest fishing harbour from where you can enjoy some of the islands most memorable sunset views and enjoy a traditional Cypriot meze meal at one of the small selection of family run tavernas.</p>
                <p>For nature lovers the start of the protected Akamas Peninsula is just to the north of the village. Paphos Town approximately 13 kilometres away, was once the capital of the island is now included in the official UNESCO list of cultural and natural treasures of the worldâ€™s heritage. The remains of villas, palaces, theatres, fortresses and tombs mean that the town is of exceptional architectural and historic value. The well preserved mosaics and the Tombs of the Kings are probably the biggest cultural draw with further archeological discoveries continually being made. Ano Pafos on the cliff is the main administrative centre and residential district while Kato Pafos, by the sea, is the main tourist area built around the harbour and medieval port.<br>
                The Paphos Zoo and the Horse Riding Stables which cater for all ages are both within the Sea Caves area and only a few minutes drive away.</p>
                <p>Mini golf, watersports and go-karting are all activities available in the resort of Coral Bay and if you extend your exploring to encompass the town of Paphos, the list of available activities expands to include a bowling alley, waterpark, several Heritage sites, attractive harbour area and modern shopping facilities. For the golf enthusiasts, there are 4 golf courses; Tsada Golf Course, Secret Valley Golf Course, Aphrodite Hills Golf Course and Elea Golf Course all within approximately a 30 minute drive.</p>
                <h3>Coast/Beach</h3>
                <p>The beautiful beach resort of Coral Bay is often described as the best bay on the west of the island. And itâ€™s no surprise, when you consider the calm turquoise sea, dipping gently into some of the clearest off shore diving space in the Mediterranean, the scattered palm trees, the 600 meters of soft white sand and, in summertime, the almost cloudless blue skies. Coral Bay is a 10 minute walk from the villa.
                <h3>Golf</h3>
                <p>4 Championship golf courses within a 30 min drive.</p>
                <h3>Skiing</h3>
                <p>Skiing is possible in Troodos during January to March</p>
                <h3>Akamas National Park</h3>
                <p>Located in the west of Cyprus the Akamas National Park is possibly the most picturesque corner of the island. Covering approximately 230 square kilometers the Akamas peninsula is where you will find wild landscape, amazing natural beauty, deep gorges, and wide sandy bays. The diversity of wildlife is of outstanding ecological importance for the Mediterranean and the wide variety of fauna is certainly impressive. Here you can find 168 different varieties of birds, 12 different mammals, 20 different reptiles and 16 different species of butterfly.<br>
                The importance of the Akamas Peninsula is recognized far beyond the shores of Cyprus. The European Council has included the Akamas Peninsula within its Mediterranean protection programme and within Cyprus; Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace are campaigning hard for the Akamas Peninsula to be declared a National Park.</p>

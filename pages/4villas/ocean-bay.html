                <h3>Coast/Beach</h3>
                <p>The beautiful beach resort of Coral Bay is often described as the best bay on the west of the island. And it’s no surprise, when you consider the calm turquoise sea, dipping gently into some of the clearest off shore diving space in the Mediterranean, the scattered palm trees, the 600 meters of soft white sand and, in summertime, the almost cloudless blue skies. Coral Bay centre is a mere 600m from the villa.</p>
                <h3>Location Description</h3>
                <p>Coral Bay is the well known beach resort for the Paphos district and the villa is located just 300 metres from the main beach at Coral Bay with the centre of the resort being less than a kilometer away.
                This family oriented area has become a lively resort with plenty to offer in terms of amenities and activities. A small complex consisting of a supermarket, a small collection of restaurants and a couple of bars is within a few minutes walk of the villa. The centre of the resort which features a wide selection of restaurants offering both Cypriot and International Cuisines, cafes, bars, shops, a choice of supermarkets, several banks, a chemist and a laundry within 1km of the villa.<br>
                A regular bus service is located within a few minutes walk of the villa operating to Coral Bay centre, Paphos town and Kato Paphos harbour.<br>
                The resort boasts two sandy beaches, the busier of the two being the popular Coral Bay Beach, a sandy horseshoe shaped bay honoured with a Blue Flag of the European Union. Sunbeds and umbrellas are available for hire, watersports are on offer and there are two beach cafés providing refreshments.</p>
                <p>A little further along the coast you reach the natural rock caves of the area known locally as Sea Caves, an area which provides ideal snorkelling territory and is popular with local scuba diving schools.<br>
                For a taste of the more traditional head to the tiny fishing hamlet of St Georges from where you can enjoy some of the islands most memorable sunset views and dine at one of the small collection of family run tavernas. For nature lovers the start of the protected Akamas Peninsula is just to the north of the village. Or you can head to the hillside village of Peyia, located just a few kilometres inland from Coral Bay to sample a traditional Cypriot meze meal at one of its small selection of long established tavernas and village coffee shops.</p>
                <p>Paphos Town approximately 15 kilometres away, was once the capital of the island is now included in the official UNESCO list of cultural and natural treasures of the world’s heritage. The remains of villas, palaces, theatres, fortresses and tombs mean that the town is of exceptional architectural and historic value. The well preserved mosaics and the Tombs of the Kings are probably the biggest cultural draw with further archaeological discoveries continually being made. Ano Pafos on the cliff is the main administrative centre and residential district while Kato Pafos, by the sea, is the main tourist area built around the harbour and medieval port.</p>
                <p>Mini golf, watersports and go-karting are all activities available in the immediate Coral Bay area. The Paphos Zoo and the Horse Riding Stables which cater for all ages are both within a 10 minute drive of the villa.<br>

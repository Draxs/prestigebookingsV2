Sunbeds and umbrellas are available for hire, water-sports are on offer and there are two beach cafes providing refreshments.</p>
                <p>A little further along the coast you reach the natural rock caves of the area known locally as Sea Caves, an area which provides ideal snorkeling territory and is popular with local scuba diving schools. For a taste of the more traditional head to the tiny fishing hamlet of St Georges from where you can enjoy some of the islands most memorable sunset views and dine at one of the small collection of family run tavernas. For nature lovers the start of the protected Akamas Peninsula is just to the north of the village. Or you can head to the hillside village of Peyia, approx. 3-4 kilometers inland from Coral Bay to sample a traditional Cypriot meze meal at one of its small selection of long established tavernas and village coffee shops.</p>

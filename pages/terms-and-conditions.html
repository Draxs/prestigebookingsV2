    <p>To make a booking, you must complete the booking confirmation pages on our website. To confirm your

    Payment can be made using our online payment system, or alternatively you can request that one of our
    operations team contacts you to make payment over the telephone. We reserve the right to return your
    deposit and decline to issue a booking confirmation at our absolute discretion. If we are unable to
    accept your booking or there is any reason why we are unable to process your booking, we shall return
    your payment within 14 days.</p>
    <p>A binding agreement will only come into existence between you and us when we issue and dispatch a confirmation to the party leader. Until then we shall be under no liability to you whatsoever. Please note we accept no liability for any item/arrangement not confirmed on our invoice. Upon receipt, if you believe that any details on the confirmation invoice or any other document
    are wrong you must advise us immediately as changes cannot be made later and it may harm your rights
    if we are not notified of any inaccuracies in any document immediately.</p>
    <p>The balance of the holiday price if using a standard rate must be paid no later than 70 days prior to
    arrival or at the time of booking if within 70 days. If we do not receive this balance in full and on time,
    we reserve the right to treat your booking as cancelled by you in which case the cancellation charges set
    out in clause 6 below will become payable.</p>
    <p>These Booking Conditions and any agreement to which they apply are governed in all respects by Cyprus
    law. We both agree that any dispute, claim or other matter which arises between us out of or in
    connection with your contract or booking will be dealt with by the Courts of Cyprus only.</p>
    <h5>Arrivals & Departure</h5>
    <p>On arrival you must be prepared to present your confirmation details as well as your passport or identity
    card to us or to our representatives. Arrival time will be from 16:00 on the day of commencement of the
    rental and departure time will be no later than 10:00 on the morning of departure. No changing of these
    arrival or departure times is allowed unless previously agreed with Prestige Bookings, and there may be
    an extra charge payable in resort for the extra use of the villa.</p>
    <p>To ensure everything is prepared for your arrival and departure Prestige Bookings require you to email your arrival and departure flight details (including flight numbers) a minimum of 7 days before your arrival date. Failure to do so may result in a
    delay in accessing the property and Prestige Bookings accept no responsibility nor will offer any
    compensation whatsoever in the event you fail to send the required details in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>On arrival you will be met by a Prestige Bookings representative at the agreed meeting point and time, and
    taken to your accommodation. You are required to telephone the number supplied with the arrival
    instructions when leaving the airport in order to agree a meeting place and time to meet up. Please note
    that you should then proceed directly to the meeting place as if you stop off to shop, eat or for any
    other reason and don’t arrive at the agreed meeting place at the agreed time we may have to leave to
    deal with another arrival resulting in delays whilst you await our return. In these circumstances Prestige
    Bookings accept no responsibility whatsoever and no compensation will be offered.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">2. Payment</h4>
    <p>In order to confirm your stay the following rate terms will apply;</p>
    <h5 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">All Standard Rate Bookings</h5>
    <p>A deposit of 30% of the full payment (or full payment if booking within 70 days of arrival) must be paid
    at the time of booking. Payment can be made by credit/debit card. Bookings are only confirmed once
    the payment has been received by us. The remaining balance is then due no later than 70 days before
    arrival. Prestige Bookings Charge the card originally used to make the booking for the remaining balance
    no later than 70 days before the arrival. Please note that we will only contact you about this if the card is
    declined by your bank. If you wish to pay the balance with a different card you must contact Prestige
    Bookings beforehand and supply the new card number and details.</p>
    <p><b>This deposit is not refundable in the event of your cancellation or failure to pay on time as set out below.</b></p>
    <p>The balance of the cost of your stay must be received by us not less than 70 days prior to arrival (or at
    the time of booking if this date has passed). This date will be shown on the confirmation invoice. If you
    have not paid in full and on time we reserve the right to treat your booking as cancelled by you. In this
    case the cancellation charges set out in clause 6 below will be payable.</p>
    <h5 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">All Non-Refundable Rate Bookings</h5>
    <p>Non-Refundable rates are discount rates you receive for paying the full balance at the time of booking.
    These rates are not refundable under any circumstances and are also restricted to no date or property
    changes. We highly recommend that you take out a comprehensive travel insurance policy to cover
    everyone in your party. Click the following link to check out the comprehensive benefits offered by our
    partner Europesure and underwritten by Lloyd’s of London; <a href="https://es10259.secure.europesuretravelinsurance.com/?action=pageone&combo_id=1" target="_blank">https://es10259.secure.europesuretravelinsurance.com/?action=pageone&combo_id=1</a></p>
    <p><b>Cancellation less than 70 days prior to arrival – no refund possible on total booking fee whichever rate
    was used for the booking</b></p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">2.1 Accidental damage</h4>
    <h5 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">Security Deposit</h5>
    <p>On arrival at the property you are required to pay a Refundable Security Deposit of €300 to €2000
    (depending on the property), which is used to protect against any breakages, loss, damage, unpaid local
    charges, additional housekeeping and any other charges. This deposit can only be paid by credit/debit
    card on arrival at the property. This amount will be released back to the card used for the payment
    approximately 7 days from departure, less any damage, losses, unpaid bills etc. Should Prestige Bookings
    make a claim on this deposit we will notify you within 72 hours of departure by email with all details of
    the claim and include full details and photographic evidence.</p>
    <p>In the event of any substantial damage/abuse to a property during your stay, you will have to leave and find alternative
    accommodation at your own cost. Should the security deposit prove inadequate to fully cover any costs
    that arise, then we reserve the right to invoice you (either directly or through our agents) for immediate
    payment of the difference. Please note that should you bring into the property anybody whatsoever
    who is not included in the booking, including but not limited to guests, catering company, wedding
    planner, DJ etc. you are responsible if any damage is caused and the cost of putting right any issues will
    be deducted from your deposit. This security deposit is charged and repaid only in Euro and In the event
    that there is any difference in exchange rate from what was charged and what was refunded, Prestige
    Bookings are not responsible for this and will offer no compensation whatsoever.</p>
    <p>Anything damaged, spoilt or broken will be charged to you at the replacement cost. This means the
    actual costs to buy the item, sourcing the item and installing the item (where applicable) Any items
    having to be purchased will be replaced ‘like for like’ to the same quality and standard.</p>
    <p>In the event that the villa or its contents are damaged or broken in any way, our lost charges will be
    deducted from the security deposit and any refund that may be due to you will be paid after repair or replacement is made for the appropriate item. Should the security deposit not cover the cost of
    repairing all the damage caused and/or replacing any items that are damaged, then we will invoice you
    for additional funds to make up the difference. You agree to pay our invoice for such additional damage
    or replacement costs before you leave the property. And when the damage is discovered after you
    leave, within 14 days of the invoice being sent to you.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">3. Your contract</h4>
    <p>A binding contract between us comes into existence when the deposit or payment is made (see clause 2
    above). If you cancel after paying the deposit our normal cancellation charges will apply. This contract
    and all matters arising out of it are governed by Cyprus law. We both agree that any dispute arising out
    of or connected with your holiday will be dealt with by the Courts of Cyprus.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">4. The cost of your stay</h4>
    <p>We reserve the right to increase or decrease the prices of accommodation at any time. The price of your
    stay will be confirmed at the time of booking, subject to the correction of errors. We reserve the right to
    correct errors in both advertised and confirmed prices. We will do so as soon as we become aware of
    the error. Please note, changes and errors occasionally occur. You must check the price of your stay at
    the time of booking. Some villas require extra payment on arrival for but not limited to, air-conditioning,
    pool heating, central heating, jacuzzi etc. etc. All extra payments required are clearly listed on the “Fine
    Print” tab of your villa on our website www.prestigebookings.com. It is your responsibility to ensure you
    are aware of any extra charges and Prestige Booking accept no responsibility whatsoever for any failure
    to make yourself aware of any charges. Any extras due must be paid for on arrival at the villa.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">5. Changes by you</h4>
    <p>Should you wish to make any changes to your confirmed booking, you must notify us by email as soon as
    possible. Whilst we will endeavour to assist, we cannot guarantee we will be able to meet any such
    requests. Where we can, an amendment fee may be payable together with any costs incurred by
    ourselves.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">6. Cancellation by you</h4>
    <p>Should you need to cancel your stay after the contract has begun (see clause 3 above), the party leader
    must immediately advise our Booking Agents either by advising them in writing (including by email).
    Your notice of cancellation will only be effective when it is received in writing by Prestige Bookings. As
    we incur costs from the time your booking is confirmed the following cancellation charges will be
    payable. Where the cancellation charge is shown as a percentage, this is calculated on the basis of the
    total cost of the booking excluding amendment charges. Amendment charges are not refundable in the
    event of cancellation.</p>
    <p>Period before start of stay within which written/email notification of cancellation is received by us</p>
    <h5 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">All Standard Rate Bookings</h5>

    <p>69 – 56 days before arrival 50% of holiday cost</p>

    <p>Discounted non-refundable rate bookings require full payment at the time of booking and are
    <b>absolutely non-refundable under any circumstances.</b></p>
    <p>Depending on the reason for cancellation, you may be able to reclaim these cancellation charges (less
    any applicable excess) under the terms of any insurance policy you may have. Claims must be made
    directly to the insurance company concerned. Prestige Bookings highly recommend that you take out a
    comprehensive travel insurance policy to cover everyone in your party. Click the following link to check
    out the comprehensive benefits offered by our partner Europesure and underwritten by Lloyd’s of

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">7. Insurance</h4>
    <p>It is part of this contract that you take out adequate travel insurance. Please read your policy details
        carefully. It is your responsibility to ensure that the insurance cover you purchase is adequate for your
        particular needs. We highly recommend that you take out a comprehensive travel insurance policy to
        cover everyone in your party. Click the following link to check out the comprehensive benefits offered
        by our partner Europesure and underwritten by Lloyd’s of London;

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">8. Changes and cancellation by us</h4>
    <p>Occasionally, we have to make changes to and correct errors on our website descriptions and other
    details both before and after bookings have been confirmed and cancel confirmed bookings. Whilst we
    always endeavour to avoid changes and cancellations, we must reserve the right to do so.</p>
    <p>If we have to make a significant change to or cancel, you’re booking, we will tell you as soon as possible.
    We will endeavour to offer you an alternative should a significant change or cancellation occur.</p>
    <p>We regret we cannot pay any expenses, costs or losses incurred by you because of any change or cancellation.</p>
    <p>Very rarely, we may be forced by “force majeure” (see clause 9) to change or terminate your stay after
    departure but before the scheduled end of your time away. This is extremely unlikely but if this situation
    does occur, we regret we will be unable to make any refunds, pay you any compensation or meet any
    costs or expenses you incur as a result.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">9. Force Majeure</h4>
    <p>Except where otherwise expressly stated in these Booking Conditions we will not be liable or pay you
    compensation if our contractual obligations to you are affected by  "force majeure". For the purposes of
    these Booking Conditions, Force majeure means any event beyond our or our supplier’s control, the
    consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.
    Such events may include war or threat of war, riot, civil strife, actual or threatened terrorist activity,
    industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, adverse weather conditions, fire, significant risks to
    human health such as the outbreak of serious disease at the travel destination and all similar events
    outside our control which make it impossible to travel safely to the travel destination or remain at the travel destination, construction in the area by third parties, the act of any government or other national
    or local authority including port or river authorities, industrial dispute, labour strikes, lock closure,
    chemical or biological disaster, unavoidable technical problems with transport and all similar events
    outside our or the supplier(s) concerned’ s control..</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">10. Our Liability to you</h4>
    <p>10.1. We promise to provide your accommodation with reasonable skill and care. We do not accept
    responsibility if any death, personal injury, failure or deficiency of your accommodation arrangements is
    not caused by any fault of ours. When we talk about fault above, this means failure by ourselves to use
    reasonable skill and care in performing or providing the service in question. Please note it is your
    responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish to make a claim.</p>
    <p>We will not be responsible for any injury, illness, death, loss (for example loss of enjoyment), damage,
    expense, cost or other sum or claim of any description whatsoever which results from any of the
    following: –</p>
    <p>(a) the fault of the person(s) affected or any member(s) of their party or</p>
    <p>(b) the fault of a third party not connected with the provision of your accommodation by us which we
    could not have predicted or avoided or</p>
    <p>(c) an event or circumstance which could not have predicted or avoided even after taking all reasonable
    care (see clause 9)</p>
    <p>In addition, we will not be responsible where you do not enjoy your stay or suffer any problems because
    of a reason you did not tell us about when you booked your stay, or where any problems you suffer did
    not result from any breach of our contract, or other fault of ourselves or any losses, expenses, costs or
    other sum you have suffered related to any business.</p>
    <p>Please note, we cannot accept responsibility for any services that do not form part of our contract. This
    includes, for example, any additional services or facilities; any other supplier agrees to provide for you.</p>
    <p>10.2. The promises we make to you about the accommodation we have agreed to provide or arrange as
    part of our contract – and the laws and regulations of the country in which your claim or complaint
    occurred – will be used as the basis for deciding whether the accommodation in question had been
    properly provided. If the particular accommodation which gave rise to the claim or complaint complied
    with local laws and regulations applicable to those accommodation at the time, the accommodation will
    be treated as having been properly provided. This will be the case even if the accommodation did not
    comply with the laws and regulations of the UK (or your country of origin) which would have applied had
    that accommodation been provided in the UK (or your country of origin).</p>
    <p>10.3. *We limit the maximum amount we may have to pay you for any and all claims or parts of claims
    which do not involve personal injury, illness or death. Except where loss of and/or damage to luggage or
    personal possessions is concerned or a lower limitation of liability applies to your claim, the maximum
    amount we will have to pay you for such non personal injury claims if we are found liable to you on any
    basis is twice the price (excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges) paid by or on behalf of
    the person(s) affected in total. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone
    wrong and you have not received any benefit at all from your stay.</p>
    <p>*We are not liable for loss of and/or damage to any luggage or personal possessions (including money) whatsoever.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">11. Complaints and problems</h4>
    <p>In the unlikely event that you have any reason to complain or experience any problems with your stay
    whilst away, you must immediately inform us. Any verbal notification must be put in writing and given
    to us within 48 hours. Until we know about a problem or complaint, we cannot begin to resolve it. Most
    problems can be dealt with quickly. For all complaints and claims which do not involve death, personal
    injury or illness, we regret we cannot accept liability if you fail to notify the complaint or claim entirely in
    accordance with this clause.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">12. Behavior</h4>
    <p>You accept responsibility for any damage or loss caused by you or any member of your party. Full
    payment for any such damage or loss must be paid direct to the owner at the time. If you fail to do so,
    you will be responsible for meeting any legal costs we incur in full, in recovering full payment from you.</p>
    <p>We expect all clients to have consideration for other people. If in our reasonable opinion or in the
    reasonable opinion of any other person in authority, you or any member of your party behaves in such a
    way as to cause or be likely to cause danger, upset or distress to any third party or damage to the
    property, or in any way damage the reputation and/or goodwill of the Owner, we are entitled, without
    prior notice, to terminate the occupation of the person(s) concerned. In this situation, the person(s)
    concerned will be required to leave the accommodation. We will have no further responsibility toward
    such person(s). No refunds will be made, and we will not pay any expenses or costs incurred as a result
    of the termination.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">12.1 NO SMOKING AND NO PETS:</h4>
    <p>Please respect our policy that NO SMOKING and NO PETS are allowed inside our properties. Additional
    cleaning fee of €300 applies in the event these rules are broken</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">12.2 VILLA OCCUPENCY/PARTIES:</h4>
    <p>No parties are allowed at the villa and the number of guests at a villa can never exceed the number of
    guests booked for that specific villa, without written consent from Prestige Bookings. In case the
    number of guests exceeds the number of guests booked for the villa without written consent, or an
    unauthorised party is held in the property, or there is any disturbance and or complaints due to
    excessive noise, you will lose the full amount of the Security Deposit. Additionally, should any large
    gathering of people other than those noted on our invoice take place (e.g. a party or wedding reception)
    we must be informed about it at the time of booking. If we can accommodate this, you will be charged
    an extra cost and the refundable security deposit payable on arrival will be doubled. If any disturbance /
    noise continuous, you can be removed from the villa without any right of a refund or reimbursement for
    the remainder of your stay and without the obligation for to find any alternative accommodation for
    you and your guests.</p>
    <h3>Prestige Bookings have the right to enter the premises of the villa and the villa
    itself at any time to be able to check upon any of the above-mentioned items.</h3>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">13. Special requests and medical problems</h4>
    <p>If you have any special request, you must advise us at the time of booking and clearly note it in the extra
    information section of the booking form. *Although we will endeavour to meet any reasonable requests,
    we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met. Failure to meet any special request will not be a
    breach of contract on our part. We regret we cannot accept any conditional bookings, i.e. any booking
    which is specified to be conditional on the fulfilment of a particular request. All such bookings will be
    treated as standard bookings subject to the above provisions on special requests.</p>
    <p>If you or any member of your party has any medical problem or disability that may affect your stay,
    please tell us before you confirm your booking so that we can advise as to the suitability of the chosen
    arrangements. In any event, you must give us full details in writing at the time of booking. If we
    reasonably feel unable to properly accommodate the particular needs of the person concerned, we
    must reserve the right to decline their reservation or, if full details are not given at the time of booking,
    cancel when we become aware of these details.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">14. Passports, visas, and health requirements</h4>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in possession of all necessary travel and health documents
    (including Passports and Visas (where applicable) before departure. You must pay all costs incurred in
    obtaining such documentation. You must check passport and visa requirements with the Embassy or
    Consulate of the country(i.e.) to or through which you are intending to travel.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">15. Prices and Website Accuracy</h4>
    <p>Please note, the information and prices shown on our website may have changed by the time you come
    to book your stay. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the website and prices at the
    time of requesting the booking, regrettably errors do occasionally occur. You must therefore ensure you
    check all details of your stay (including the price) on your booking acceptance. All of our rates are in €
    (Euros), and you will be charged the Euro price indicated for the booking. Some third-party agents
    display an indicative rate in different currencies, and this is for guidance purposes only, and has no
    relation to our rates or charges. We will charge the booking in Euros, and any currency conversion will
    be done by either the bank or card company. Prestige Bookings accept no responsibility whatsoever for
    conversion rates, and will under no circumstances offer compensation for any currency difference.</p>

    will not be taken into consideration and no refunds will be given.</p>

    <p>Please note that the property is not an official tourist structure, such as a hotel, residences, etc. but a
    private dwelling. Being such, there is no standard or categories that are internationally recognized;
    indeed, it reflects the architecture and furnishings, the local traditions and the personal taste of the
    Owner. This is precisely the kind of holiday that we offer: the chance to partake in the culture of the
    area chosen, living for a few weeks in the same surroundings as an inhabitant would. We cannot
    however exclude the possibility that these differences can sometimes result in minor inconveniences –
    due to the special nature of its architecture and of traditions in the area – but which cannot be accepted
    as complaints.</p>
